# Block Elements

## Headers
Use 1-6 hash characters at the start of the line, corresponding to header levels 1-6. For example:

    # This is an H1
    ## This is an H2
    ###### This is an H6

## Blockquotes
Markdown uses > characters for blockquoting. Just put the > character at the beginning of each line you need to quote. For example:

    >This is a quote line.
    >This is anothoer quote line.

Blockquotes can be nested (i.e. a blockquote-in-a-blockquote) by adding additional levels of >:

    > This is the first level of quoting.
    >
    > > This is nested blockquote.
    >
    > Back to the first level.

## Lists
Markdown supports ordered and unorder lists.

Unordered lists use asterisks(*), pluses(+), or hyphens(-) interchangably as list markers. For example:

    *   Red
    *   Green
    *   Blue

Ordered lists use numbers followed by periods.

    1.  Bird
    2.  McHale
    3.  Parish
